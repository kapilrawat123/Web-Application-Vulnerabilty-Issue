# ðŸŽƒ In-Band vs Out-of-Band XXE

**In-band XXE** refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker can see the response from the server. This allows for straightforward data exfiltration and exploitation. The attacker can simply send a malicious XML payload to the application, and the server will respond with the extracted data or the result of the attack.

**Out-of-band XXE**, on the other hand, refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker cannot see the response from the server. This requires using alternative channels, such as DNS or HTTP requests, to exfiltrate data. To extract the data, the attacker must craft a malicious XML payload that will trigger an out-of-band request, such as a DNS query or an HTTP request.
### In-Band XXE Exploitation

If the application  returns the value of the parameter, we can inject an entity that is pointing to `/etc/passwd` to disclose its values.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<contact>
<name>&xxe;</name>
<email>test@test.com</email>
<message>test</message>
</contact>
```

### XML Entity Expansion

XML Entity Expansion is a technique often used in XXE attacks that involves defining entities within an XML document, which the XML parser then expands. Attackers can abuse this feature by creating recursive or excessively large entities, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or defining external entities referencing sensitive files or services. This method is central to both in-band and out-of-band XXE, as it allows attackers to inject malicious entities into the XML data. For example:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "This is a test message" >]>
<contact><name>&xxe; &xxe;
</name><email>test@test.com</email><message>test</message></contact>
```

In the payload above, `&xxe;` is expanded wherever it appears. Attackers can use entity expansion to perform a Billion Laughs attack, where a small XML document recursively expands to consume server resources, leading to a denial of service.
